# DevTogether
Platform created especially for developers to share their knowledge by publishing articles. It is a micro-frontend application created with Nx. My main motivation was to play around with the modern technology stack, to master and use in practise the advanced concepts of Angular, become competent in state management and use NgRx's potential to its fullest, also become consistent and learn how to properly create unit & E2E tests.
