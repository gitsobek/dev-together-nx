Blog platform created especially for developers who want to share their knowledge by publishing technology related articles. It is a micro-frontend project created with Nx. It consists a suite of a modern and powerful web stack:

- Angular
- TypeScript
- ngrx
- Cypress
- Jest

## Motivation

My main motivation was to play around with a modern technology stack in order to gain more experience and sharpen my dev skills. My desire was to master and use in practise the advanced concepts of Angular, become competent in state management and use NgRx's potential to its fullest, also become consistent and learn how to properly create unit & E2E tests. Everything - I mean every UI component and every functionality & logic on which all components rely on and every different feature is made from scratch, no third-party libraries are used.

## Demo
[Click here!](https://dev-together-d9f89.web.app/) Keep in mind that this project is still under development. Try to not to refresh the application when browsing, because everything is stored in-memory.

## Plans
After completing this project, my next goal will be to create a backend server in Spring (Java) and integrate it with this application.
